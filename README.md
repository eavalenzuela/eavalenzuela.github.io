### Hello
##### February 27, 2018

This is my personal blog, future CV, and book/video/tutorial review repository all in one. 

I've recently been working on several security side-projects-disguised-as-work-projects(i.e. they're both), and it's really given me an appreciation for learning how to do stuff yourself, low-level.

I've built an RPC layer for scapy, a counterpart to Responder.py, and last week started on a multi-service honeypot, called 'multi-service-honeypot'. I've been using them to learn scapy, and brush up on threading.

My goal is to add articles once a week at least, so we'll see how that goes.
